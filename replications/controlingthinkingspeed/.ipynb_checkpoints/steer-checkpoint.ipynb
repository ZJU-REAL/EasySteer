      "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(10x^3 - \\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^5\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power, like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, in this case, \\(a\\) is \\(10x^3\\), \\(b\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), and \\(n\\) is 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so the general term in the expansion will be \\(\\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, let me write that down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's compute the exponent of \\(x\\) in each term. The exponent from \\((10x^3)^{5 - k}\\) is \\(3(5 - k)\\), and the exponent from \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\) is \\(-2k\\). So, the total exponent of \\(x\\) in each term is \\(3(5 - k) - 2k\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me simplify that: \\(15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k\\). So, the exponent of \\(x\\) is \\(15 - 5k\\). We need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set up the equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\(15 - 5k = 0\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving for \\(k\\):\n",

      "Divide both sides by 5:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\(k = 3\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\). Let me compute that term.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, compute the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\). I know that \\(\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{3! \\times 2!} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\\). So, the binomial coefficient is 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, compute \\((10x^3)^{5 - 3}\\), which is \\((10x^3)^2\\). That's \\(10^2 \\times (x^3)^2 = 100x^6\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, compute \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3\\). Let's break that down. First, the coefficient: \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = -\\frac{1}{8}\\). Then, the variable part: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{x^6}\\). So, putting it together, that term is \\(-\\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{x^6} = -\\frac{1}{8x^6}\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, multiply all these together: the binomial coefficient times the first term times the second term.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that's \\(10 \\times 100x^6 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{8x^6}\\right)\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me compute that step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, multiply the constants: \\(10 \\times 100 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Compute \\(10 \\times 100 = 1000\\). Then, \\(1000 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{1000}{8} = -125\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, multiply the \\(x\\) terms: \\(x^6 \\times \\frac{1}{x^6} = x^{6 - 6} = x^0 = 1\\).\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: Find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(10x^3 - \\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^5\\). Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power, like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, in this case, \\(a\\) is \\(10x^3\\), \\(b\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\), and \\(n\\) is 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the general term in the expansion would be \\(\\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, my goal is to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(x\\) in that term is zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me write that down. The exponent of \\(x\\) in each term is given by the exponent in \\(a^{5 - k}\\) plus the exponent in \\(b^k\\). So, for \\(a^{5 - k}\\), the exponent is \\(3(5 - k)\\), since \\(a = 10x^3\\). For \\(b^k\\), the exponent is \\(-2k\\), because \\(b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the total exponent of \\(x\\) in the term is \\(3(5 - k) + (-2k)\\). Let me compute that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\(3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k\\).\n",

      "I need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set up the equation:\n",

      "Divide both sides by 5:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\(k = 3\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Now, let me compute that term.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, compute the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\). I know that \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so:\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay, so the binomial coefficient is 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, compute \\((10x^3)^{5 - 3}\\), which is \\((10x^3)^2\\). Let's compute that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\(10^2 = 100\\), and \\(x^{3 \\times 2} = x^6\\). So, \\((10x^3)^2 = 100x^6\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, compute \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3\\). Let's break that down:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the coefficient: \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) raised to the 3rd power is \\(-\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the variable part: \\(x^{-2}\\) raised to the 3rd power is \\(x^{-6}\\), which is the same as \\(\\frac{1}{x^6}\\).\n",
